JavaScript is a scripting programming language created in the 1990s by Brendan Eich and Netscape. It is mostly used on websites to provide interaction between the page and the user by responding to events, validating data entered in forms, or creating visual effects. JavaScript can also be used on the server side with the Node.js platform. It is an environment similar to, for example, Ruby, but based on JavaScript. By transferring JS to servers, we have a similarity to the version used in browsers. Therefore, individuals who write scripts for web pages can quickly adapt to writing scripts for servers.
