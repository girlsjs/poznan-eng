To start writing code in JavaScript, you don't need much. Initially, all you need is a web browser and a text editor. Later on, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will also come in handy. 

### Web Browser

You can work with any web browser of your choice. However, for the purpose of this course, we recommend using Google Chrome due to its well-developed debugger.

### Text Editor

A text editor is the tool where we will write our code. You can even use Notepad (built-in Windows application), more convenient, however, would be for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
