Hi there! We're excited that you want to embark on your JavaScript journey with us. Why JavaScript, you ask? It's simple: there is currently no more popular and essential programming language. Without JavaScript, websites would lack interactive elements, among other things. Moreover, GitHub statistics [confirm](http://githut.info/) that JavaScript is currently the number one language on the web, and the demand for JavaScript programmers is growing!
